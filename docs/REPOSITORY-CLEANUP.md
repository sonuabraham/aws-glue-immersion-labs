# Repository Cleanup Guide

## Files to Remove from Git

The following files/folders should be removed from the repository as they are generated by scripts:

### 1. glue-workshop/ folder
**Why:** This entire folder is created by `scripts/create-glue-workshop-zip.sh`

**Remove from git:**
```bash
git rm -r glue-workshop/
git commit -m "Remove generated glue-workshop folder"
```

### 2. glue-workshop.zip
**Why:** This is the packaged output of the glue-workshop folder

**Remove from git:**
```bash
git rm glue-workshop.zip
git commit -m "Remove generated zip file"
```

## What's in .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file now includes:
- `glue-workshop/` - Generated workshop structure
- `glue-workshop.zip` - Generated package
- Python cache files
- IDE files
- OS-specific files
- AWS credentials (for safety)

## How Users Generate These Files

Users will run:
```bash
cd scripts
./create-glue-workshop-zip.sh
cd ..
zip -r glue-workshop.zip glue-workshop/
```

This creates:
1. `glue-workshop/` folder with all sample data
2. `glue-workshop.zip` package ready for deployment

## Repository Structure (After Cleanup)

```
.
├── .gitignore                      # Ignores generated files
├── README.md                       # Main documentation
├── docs/                           # Documentation
│   ├── README-LOCAL-SETUP.md
│   ├── LAB1-DATA-GUIDE.md
│   └── glue-workshop-structure.md
├── infra/                          # CloudFormation templates
│   ├── GlueImmersionDay-LocalDeployment-v2.yaml
│   └── GlueImmersionDay-LocalDeployment-v1.yaml
├── scripts/                        # Automation scripts
│   ├── create-glue-workshop-zip.sh # Generates glue-workshop/
│   └── one-step-setup.sh
└── glue-workshop-labs/            # Original lab content
    └── lab1/ through lab12/
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Smaller Repository**: No generated files in version control
2. **Always Fresh**: Users generate latest data structure
3. **Customizable**: Users can modify the generation script for their needs
4. **No Conflicts**: Generated files won't cause merge conflicts
5. **Clear Separation**: Source vs. generated content

## Verification

After cleanup, verify:
```bash
# Check what's tracked
git ls-files | grep glue-workshop

# Should return nothing (or only glue-workshop-labs/)

# Check .gitignore is working
git status

# Should not show glue-workshop/ or glue-workshop.zip as untracked
```
